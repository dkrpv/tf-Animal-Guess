# Ultimate Animal guesser 9000
23/08/2019 - 19:47
The original plan, is to use TensorFlow for python, and make a deep learning Animal Guesser
You give the "Animal Guesser 9000" a picture, and it tries to guess what animal is on it
I shall most likely feed tensorflow the color codes and the position of colors compared to each other, and see how will it work.
For color recognition I will use Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
Update 19:57: It appears that most animal databases are online.
  Update 20:03 - Im making the database with like a 1000 pictures myself.
  
p.s 
Also noticed a problem with the colorcode idea, if for normal animals it will work just fine, for cat's and dogs of different breeds it doesn't. Oh well.
